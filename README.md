# New-Kepard
Hello, this project was inspired by [Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pillaOxGCo).
My goal was to recreate it in Kerbal Space Program with using [kRPC mod](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/62902-130-krpc-remote-procedure-call-server-v039-14th-june-2017/). Here is shown what I created: [montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwAmZyfuj9I) and [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_b5-HEn9jc). You can find Java code in the folder "kepard", and runnable program in "compiled" folder. If you have any suggestions or found a bug, please contact with me. I appreciate your help.
